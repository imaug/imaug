# Overview

# Changed

## Drop (explicit) six dependency [#17](https://github.com/imaug/imaug/pull/17)

The `six` dependency is a remainder of the (now unofficial) Python 2.7 support. Python 2.7 is EOL since early 2020, therefore `imaug` will remove most of the code which tries to maintain the 2.7 compatibiltiy in its upcomming 0.5.0 release.
