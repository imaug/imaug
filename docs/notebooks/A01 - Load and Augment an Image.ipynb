    "**Expected input data.** Augmenting an image with `imgaug` takes only a few lines of code. But before doing that, we first have to load the image. `imgaug` expects images to be numpy arrays and works best with dtype `uint8`, i.e. when the array's values are in the range `0` to `255`. The channel-axis is always expected to be the last axis and may be skipped for grayscale images. For non-grayscale images, the expected input colorspace is RGB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-uint8 data.** If you work with other dtypes than `uint8`, such as `float32`, it is recommended to take a look at the [dtype documentation](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/dtype_support.html) for a rough overview of each augmenter's dtype support. The [API](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api.html) contains further details. Keep in mind that `uint8` is always the most thoroughly tested dtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image loading function.** As `imgaug` only deals with augmentation and not image input/output, we will need another library to load our image. A common choice to do that in python is `imageio`, which we will use below. Another common choice is OpenCV via its function `cv2.imread()`. Note however that `cv2.imread()` returns images in BGR colorspace and not RGB, which means that you will have to re-order the channel axis, e.g. via `cv2.imread(path)[:, :, ::-1]`. You could alternatively also change every colorspace-dependent augmenter to BGR (e.g. `Grayscale` or any augmenter changing hue and/or saturation). See the [API](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api.html) for details per augmenter. The disadvantage of the latter method is that all visualization functions (such as `imgaug.imshow()` below) are still going to expect RGB data and hence BGR images will look broken."

    "As you can see, all of the images in the batch were automatically rotated by different amounts. That's because when instantiating our affine transformation via `rotate = iaa.Affine(rotate=(-25, 25))`, we used an interval for the rotation, given as `(-25, 25)`, which denotes a uniform distribution `rotate ~ uniform(-25, 25)`. We could have also picked a constant value `rotate=-25` to always rotate by -25° or a list `rotate=[-25, -15, 0]` to rotate by -25° or by -15° or by 0°. We could have also pick many other probability distributions, such as gaussian or poisson distributions. Take a look at the other notebooks or at [the documentation](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/parameters.html) for details on how to do that.\n",

We could have also provided a *single numpy array* of shape `(N, H, W, [C])`, where `N` would have been the number of images, `H` their height, `W` their width and `C` (optionally) the channel-axis. Using numpy arrays is generally preferred, as they save memory and can be a little bit faster to augment. However, if your images have different heights, widths or numbers of channels they cannot be combined to a single array and hence a list must be used."
