    "Augmentation can be a slow process, especially when working with large images and when combining many different augmentation techniques. Take a look at the [performance documentation](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/performance.html) for some lower bounds on the expected single core performance using outdated hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve performance is to augment simultaneously on multiple CPU cores. `imgaug` offers a native system to do that. It is based on roughly the following steps:\n",
    "  1. Split the dataset into batches. Each batch contains one or more images and the additional data associated with them, e.g. bounding boxes or segmentation maps. (Splitting the data can also be done on the fly using a generator.)\n",
    "  2. Start one or more child processes. Each of them runs on its own CPU core.\n",
    "  3. Send batches to the child processes. Try to distribute them equally over the child processes so that each of them has a similar amount of work to do.\n",
    "  4. Let the child processes augment the data.\n",
    "  5. Receive the augmented batches from the child processes.\n",
    "A few important points can be derived from these steps. First, the data has to be split into batches. Second, combining all data into one batch and using multicore augmentation is pointless, as each individual batch is augmented by exactly one core. Third, using multicore augmentation for small amounts of data can also be pointless as starting the child processes might take up more time than simply augmenting the dataset on a single CPU core. (Though, you can re-use the child processes between epochs, so it might still pay off.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: `imgaug` offers multicore features and it is recommended to use them for multicore augmentation. It is **not** recommended to execute `imgaug` in a custom-made multicore routine using e.g. python's `multiprocessing` library or by using the multiprocessing support of some deep learning libraries. Doing so runs a major risk to accidentally apply the same augmentations in each child worker (just to different images). If one still decides to build a custom implementation, make sure to call `imgaug.seed(value)` and `augmenter.reseed(value)` with *different seeds per child process*. Generating debug outputs per child process is then also recommended. Messing this up is easy and hard to even notice."

    "The easiest way to do multicore augmentation in `imgaug` is to call `augment_batches(..., background=True)`. It works similarly to e.g. `augment_images()`. The difference is that it expects a list of `imgaug.augmentables.batches.Batch` or `imgaug.augmentables.batches.UnnormalizedBatch` instances. Each of these instances contains the data of a batch, e.g. images or bounding boxes. Creating a batch is trivial and can be done via e.g. `batch = UnnormalizedBatch(images=<list of numpy arrays>, bounding_boxes=<list of imgaug.BoundingBoxOnImages>)`. Another difference to `augment_images()` is that `augment_batches()` returns a generator, which continuously yields augmented batches as they are received from the child processes. The final (and important) difference is that `augment_batches()` currently does *not* use the random state set in the augmenter, but rather picks a new one. That is because otherwise all child processes would apply the same augmentations (just to different images). If you need more control over the random state use `pool()` or `imgaug.multicore.Pool` instead (see further below)."

    "`augment_batches()` is easy to use, but does not offer much customization.

We configure the pool to use all CPU cores except one (`processes=-1`), restart child processes after 20 tasks (`maxtasksperchild=20`) and to start with a random number seed of `1`. The argument `maxtasksperchild` can be useful if you deal with memory leaks that lead to more and more memory consumption over time.
