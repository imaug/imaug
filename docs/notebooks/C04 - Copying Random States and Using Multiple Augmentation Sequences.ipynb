    "# Copying Random States and Using Multiple Augmentation Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "All other tutorials so far have assumed that only a single augmentation sequence is applied to all inputs. This tutorial explains how to use multiple augmentation sequences, and especially how to align the random number generation between these sequences. This is useful when augmenting images and heatmaps or segmentation maps on them. `imgaug` offers methods for heatmap and segmentation map augmentation, but these are geared towards ground truth data and will only apply geometry-affecting augmentations (e.g. gaussian noise or dropout are deactivated). If you do want to non-geometric augmentations, you will have to treat the heatmaps or segmentation maps as images and feed them through `augment_images()`, but then you might want to use augmenters and parameters that differ from the ones used for images, while still getting comparable results (e.g. crop amounts should match). This tutorial will show how to control the random number generation and thereby use multiple augmentation sequences with aligned randomness.\n",

    "## Manually Changing Parameter Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The heatmap's value range is now very different compared to before. It changed from `[0.0, 1.0]` to `[-73.75, 77.37]`. This was caused here by `AdditiveGaussianNoise`, which sampled from a gaussian distribution following `N(0, 20)`. Such a large variance is aedequate for images, but not for heatmaps. The example below shows one way to fix this. We first copy the image-specific augmentation sequence to one for heatmaps. Then -- only in the heatmap-specific sequence -- we wrap the scale argument of `AdditiveGaussianNoise` in a `Multiply(..., 0.001)`, which decreases any sampled scale value by a factor of 1000.\n",
    "(As the scale in the image-specific sequence was defined as a deterministic value of always `20`, we could also assign `iap.Deterministic(0.02)` and would have exactly the same outcome.)"

An easier solution is however available, which is based on instantiating two sequences in the standard way with slightly different parameters, and then copying the randomness from one sequence to the other one. The only requirement for a successful copy is to assign a unique name to each augmenter. Make sure that the names match between the two sequences so that the same augmenter gets the same name. Then copy once the random states from one sequence to the other and you are good to go. Example:"

    "You may wonder: If we just want the augmenters in both sequences to use similar random states, can we maybe define these random states already when instantiating these augmenters? Then we could make sure that the same augmenters get the same random states. And yes, that is possible. Every augmenter has a `random_state` argument. You can use this argument to provide a `numpy.random.RandomState` instance or simply a seed value. This makes it almost trivial to align the two sequences, as the example below shows. Note that this time we not only change the value ranges between the augmentation sequences, but also add different augmenters to both of them. This does not affect the assigned random states of the remaining augmenters. Keep in mind though that here we can only use different positions of the augmenters between the sequences, because we did not activate `random_order` in `Sequential`. Otherwise we would get mismatches, as the second augmenter in the image-sequence sequence differs from the second in the heatmap-sequence."
