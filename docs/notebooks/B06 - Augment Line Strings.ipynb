    "`imgaug` has native support for line string augmentation (currently in Beta state). A line string is a collection of many single line segments, with each having a start and end point. Line strings are -- in contrast to polygons -- not closed, i.e. no connection will be drawn or assumed between the first and last point of the whole line string.\n",

    "The following classes are relevant for line string augmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### API: LineString\n",
    "\n",
    "`imgaug.augmentables.lines.LineString(coords, [label])`: Container for a single line string. The `coords` are the points that (when connected) form the line string. They are provided as (sub-)pixel absolute coordinates. E.g. `LineString([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10)])` creates a line string with a 90° angle at `x=10`, `y=0`.\n",
    "* Properties offered by `LineString` are: `.coords` (all points), `.label` (the line string's class label, may be `None`), `.xx` (x-coordinates of all points), `.yy` (analogous), `.xx_int` (`.xx` rounded and cast to integers), `.yy_int` (analogous), `.height` (height of the line string), `.width` (analogous) and `.length` (euclidean distance between each pair of consecutive points).\n",
    "* Methods offered by `LineString` are:\n",
    "  * `get_pointwise_inside_image_mask(image)`: Generate for each point whether it is inside the provided image shape (`True`/`False`).\n",
    "  * `compute_neighbour_distances()`: Generate a list of euclidean distances between consecutive points in `coords`.\n",
    "  * `compute_pointwise_distances(other, default=None)`: Compute the distance from each point in `coords` to geometry `other` (e.g. another line string).\n",
    "  * `compute_distance(other, default=None)`: Compute the minimum distance from any location on the line string to `other`.\n",
    "  * `contains(other, max_distance=1e-4)`: Return whether `other` has a distance to the line string of less than `max_distance`.\n",
    "  * `project(from_shape, to_shape)`: Project the line string from image shape `from_shape` onto image shape `to_shape`, i.e. change the point coordinates. This is useful when resizing images.\n",
    "  * `is_fully_within_image(image, default=False)`: Estimate whether no part of the line string is outside of the given image plane.\n",
    "  * `is_partly_within_image(image, default=False)`: Estimate whether any part of the line string is inside of the image plane.\n",
    "  * `is_out_of_image(image, fully=True, partly=False, default=False)`: Estimate whether the line string is at least `partly` or `fully` outside of the image plane.\n",
    "  * `clip_out_of_image(image)`: Remove all parts of the line string that are outside of the image plane. This can split line segment, creating new coordinates on the image edges. This also returns a list of 0 to N new line strings.\n",
    "  * `find_intersections_with(other)`: Returns intersections with another object (one list of intersections per line segment).\n",
    "  * `shift(x=0, y=0)`: Move the line string along the x/y-axis.\n",
    "  * `draw_mask(image_shape, size_lines=1, size_points=0, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Convert the line string to a binary mask with shape `image_shape`. An area around the line string of size `size_lines` will be `True` in the mask.\n",
    "  * `draw_lines_heatmap_array(image_shape, alpha=1.0, size=1, antialiased=True, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Convert the line string to a heatmap array (float array, value range `[0.0, 1.0]`). This draws only the line segments of the line string, not the points.\n",
    "  * `draw_points_heatmap_array(image_shape, alpha=1.0, size=1, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Convert the line string to a heatmap array (float array, value range `[0.0, 1.0]`). This draws only the point of the line string, not the line(s).\n",
    "  * `draw_heatmap_array(image_shape, alpha_lines=1.0, alpha_points=1.0, size_lines=1, size_points=0, antialiased=True, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Combines `draw_lines_heatmap_array()` and `draw_points_heatmap_array()`.\n",
    "  * `draw_lines_on_image(image, color=(0, 255, 0), alpha=1.0, size=3, antialiased=True, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Draw the line string's line segments in color on an `uint8` image.\n",
    "  * `draw_points_on_image(image, color=(0, 128, 0), alpha=1.0, size=3, copy=True, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Draw the line string's points in color on an `uint8` image.\n",
    "  * `draw_on_image(image, color=(0, 255, 0), color_lines=None, color_points=None, alpha=1.0, alpha_lines=None, alpha_points=None, size=1, size_lines=None, size_points=None, antialiased=True, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Combines `draw_lines_on_image()` and `draw_points_on_image()`.\n",
    "  * `extract_from_image(image, size=1, pad=True, pad_max=None, antialiased=True, prevent_zero_size=True)`: Extract the area around the line string from an image. Will always return a rectangular `(H',W',C)` image array, but only the pixels belonging to the area will be non-zero.\n",
    "  * `concatenate(other)`: Add `other`'s point(s) to this line string's points.\n",
    "  * `subdivide(points_per_edge)`: Interpolates a given number of uniformly spaced new points on each line segment.\n",
    "  * `to_keypoints()`: Return the line string's points as `Keypoint` instances.\n",
    "  * `to_bounding_box()`: Return a bounding box containing all points of the line string.\n",
    "  * `to_polygon()`: Return a polygon with the same points as this line string (but closed, as all polygons are closed). Note that the resulting polygon could be invalid (e.g. self-intersecting). If that is the case, some polygon methods would raise errors when called.\n",
    "  * `to_heatmap(image_shape, size_lines=1, size_points=0, antialiased=True, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Similar to `draw_heatmap_array()`, but returns a `HeatmapsOnImage` instance (instead of an array).\n",
    "  * `to_segmentation_map(image_shape, size_lines=1, size_points=0, antialiased=True, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Similar to `to_heatmap()` but returns a segmentation map instead (class `1` wherever the line string is, `0` everywhere else).\n",
    "  * `coords_almost_equals(other, max_distance=1e-4, points_per_edge=8)`: Check whether the distance between the line string and `other` exceeds nowhere `max_distance`.\n",
    "  * `almost_equals(other, max_distance=1e-4, points_per_edge=8)`: Like `coords_almost_equals()`, but also verifies that labels are identical.\n",
    "  * `copy(coords=None, label=None)`: Creates a shallow copy of the line string.\n",
    "  * `deepcopy(coords=None, label=None)`: Creates a deep copy of the line string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API: LineStringsOnImage\n",
    "\n",
    "`imgaug.augmentables.lines.LineStringsOnImage(line_strings, shape)`: Container for a set of `LineString` instances placed on a single image. The image's shape must be provided as a tuple via the argument `shape` and is required during the augmentation to align line string and image augmentation (e.g. to sample corresponding crop values).\n",
    "* Properties of `LineStringsOnImage` are: `.line_strings`, `.shape`, `.empty` (same as `len(.line_strings) == 0`).\n",
    "* Methods of `LineStringsOnImage` are:\n",
    "  * `on(self, image)`: Calls `project(...)` on each line string in `.line_strings`.\n",
    "  * `from_xy_arrays()`: Creates a `LineStringsOnImage` instance from a list of xy-coordinate-arrays.\n",
    "  * `to_xy_arrays()`: Returns a list of xy-coordinate-arrays making up each line string.\n",
    "  * `draw_on_image(...)`: Calls `draw_on_image(...)` on each line string in `.line_strings`.\n",
    "  * `remove_out_of_image(self, fully=True, partly=False)`: Removes all line strings from `.line_strings` that are partially and/or fully outside of the image plane.\n",
    "  * `clip_out_of_image()`: Calls `clip_out_of_image()` on each line string in `.line_strings`. (This can increase the number of line strings.)\n",
    "  * `shift(...)`: Calls `shift(...)` on each line string in `.line_strings`.\n",
    "  * `copy()`: Currently an alias for `.deepcopy()`.\n",
    "  * `deepcopy()`: Creates a deep copy of this instance.\n",

    "### API: Augmentation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Line strings can be augmented using `augment(images=<image data>, line_strings=<data>)`, which is offered by all augmenters. `<data>` is fairly tolerant and accepts many different inputs, e.g. a list of lists of `LineString` or a list of list of xy-coordinate-arrays. Alternatively, `augment_line_strings(line_strings_on_image)` can be used, which is also offered by all augmenters. It expects either a single instance of `LineStringsOnImage` or a list of it. It does *not* accept `LineString` instances, because these lack the necessary image shape information in the form of `.shape`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that only augmentations that change the geometry affect line strings, e.g. affine transformations, cropping or horizontal flipping. Other augmentations, e.g. gaussian noise, only affect images.\n",
