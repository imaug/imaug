    "# Augment Heatmaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Heatmaps are in `imgaug` float32-based image-like 2D arrays. They are constrained to a known value range, usually 0.0 to 1.0. A heatmap may have any number of channels (including none). Heatmaps are represented with the class `imgaug.augmentables.heatmaps.HeatmapsOnImage`. Depending on the context, the term \"heatmap\" may denote the 2D array, a single channel within that array or an instance of `HeatmapsOnImage`. Heatmaps are commonly used as representations for the ground truth in keypoints/landmark prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an instance of `imgaug.augmentables.heatmaps.HeatmapsOnImage`, the following arguments are necessary:\n",
    "  * `arr`: The raw numpy float32 heatmap array with shape `(H,W)` or `(H,W,C)`.\n",
    "  * `shape`: The shape of the *image* to which the heatmap belongs (*not* the shape of the heatmap array).\n",
    "  * `min_value` (optional, default is 0.0): The minimum possible value of the input heatmap array. Heatmaps are internally normalized to the value range 0.0 to 1.0.\n",
    "  * `max_value` (optional, default is 1.0): Analogous to min_value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noteworthy methods of `HeatmapsOnImage` are:\n",
    "  * `get_arr()`: Returns the heatmap array, unnormalized to the value range `[min_value, max_value]`.\n",
    "  * `draw([size], [cmap])`: Convert the heatmap to an RGB image.\n",
    "  * `draw_on_image(image, [alpha], [cmap], [resize])`: Convert the heatmap to an RGB image, overlayed with the image to which it belongs.\n",
    "  * `invert()`: Transform any value in the heatmap array from `v` to `1.0-v`.\n",
    "  * `pad([top], [right], [bottom], [left], [mode], [cval])`: Pad the heatmap array.\n",
    "  * `pad_to_aspect_ratio(aspect_ratio, [mode], [cval], [return_pad_amounts])`: Analogous to `pad()`.\n",
    "  * `avg_pool([block_size])`: Average pool with given kernel size.\n",
    "  * `max_pool([block_size])`: Max pool with given kernel size.\n",
    "  * `resize([sizes], [interpolation])`: Resize the heatmap array to the provided size.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above methods (except for `get_arr()`) operate on arrays normalized to `[0.0, 1.0]`. This e.g. influences sensible values for `cval` in `pad()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of `HeatmapsOnImage` are augmented using `augment(images=..., heatmaps=...)` or `augment_heatmaps(<heatmaps>)`, both of which are offered by all augmenters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, see the [API](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api.html), e.g. [imgaug.augmentables.heatmaps.HeatmapsOnImage](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api_imgaug.html#imgaug.augmentables.heatmaps.HeatmapsOnImage), [imgaug.augmenters.meta.Augmenter.augment()](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api_augmenters_meta.html#imgaug.augmenters.meta.Augmenter.augment) or [imgaug.augmenters.meta.Augmenter.augment_heatmaps()](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/api_augmenters_meta.html#imgaug.augmenters.meta.Augmenter.augment_heatmaps).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: `imgaug`'s heatmap augmentation is geared towards ground truth outputs. As such, only augmentation techniques that change the image geometry will be applied to heatmaps, even when other augmentation techniques are part of a pipeline. Examples for that are e.g. horizontal flips or affine transformations. To also apply non-geometric augmentation techniques, feed the heatmap array through `augment_images()` instead."

The below example pads a heatmap using `HeatmapsOnImage.pad()` with pad modes `constant` (fill all new pixels with a constant value), `edge` (fill all new pixels with the value of the closest edge) and `maximum` (fill all new pixels with the maximum of the axis)."
