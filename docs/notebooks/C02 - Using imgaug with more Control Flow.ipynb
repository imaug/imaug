    "# Using imgaug with more Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard form of using `imgaug` is in a deferred way, i.e. you first \"build\" your augmentation sequence and then apply it many times to augment data. `imgaug` then handles the augmentation almost entirely on its own. This form of using the library is similar to e.g. tensorflow. In the case of `imgaug` it has a few advantages:\n",
    "* It allows the library to randomize the order in which augmenters are applied (as is e.g. the case when calling a `Sequential(..., random_order=True)` instance). This greatly increases the space of possible augmentations. Implementing such a random order oneself will likely end up with yet another architecture that lacks control flow.\n",
    "* It allows the library to easily randomize which augmenters are applied or not applied to an input, as is handled by e.g. `Sometimes(...)` or `SomeOf(...)`. This is easier to implement oneself than random order, but still leads to quite some repeated code between projects.\n",
    "* It pushes random state handling to the library, decreasing the probability of bugs when re-applying augmentations to different inputs.\n",
    "* It allows to have one entry point to run (tested) multicore augmentation. In the case of `imgaug` the method `Augmenter.pool()` is such an entry point. It starts a wrapper around `multiprocessing.Pool` that is optimized for augmentation (e.g. uses different random states between child processes to guarantee that each CPU core generates different augmentations).\n",
    "\n",
    "It does however also have disadvantages, with the main one being that errors can be quite a bit harder to debug. If you don't need the above mentioned advantages, it is possible to execute `imgaug` in a non-deferred way, similar to e.g. pytorch. The implementation of this is very similar to the standard way in `imgaug`, except that you instantiate each augmenter on its own and later on also apply it on its own. The below code block shows an example:"
