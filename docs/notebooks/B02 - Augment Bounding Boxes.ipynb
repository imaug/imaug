    "# Augment Bounding Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "`imgaug` has native support for bounding boxes and their augmentation. They are represented via their top-left and bottom-right corner coordinates, both as absolute values and with sub-pixel accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `imgaug`, bounding boxes are only affected by augmenters changing the geometry of images. This is the case for e.g. horizontal flips or affine transformations. They are not affected by other methods, such as gaussian noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two classes are provided for bounding box augmentation in `imgaug`, listed in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API: BoundingBox\n",
    "\n",
    "`imgaug.augmentables.bbs.BoundingBox(x1, y1, x2, y2, label=None)`: Container for a single bounding box, defined based on its top-left and bottom-right corners, each given as x- and y- pixel coordinates (floats, i.e. sub-pixel accurate).\n",
    "  * Important properties offered by `BoundingBox` are: `.x1`, `.y1`, `.x2`, `.y2`, `.height`, `.width`, `.area`, `.center_x`, `.center_y`.\n",
    "  * Important methods offered by `BoundingBox` are:\n",
    "    * `project(from_shape, to_shape)`: Projects the bounding box coordinates from one image shape to another.\n",
    "    * `extend([all_sides], [top], [right], [bottom], [left])`: Increases the size of the bounding boxes by pixel values along given sides.\n",
    "    * `intersection(other, [default])`: Returns the intersection bounding box of this bounding box and another one.\n",
    "    * `union(other)`: Analogous to `intersection()`, returns the union.\n",
    "    * `iou(other)`: Computes the IoU of this bounding box and another one.\n",
    "    * `is_fully_within_image(image)`: Determines whether all bounding box coordinates are inside the image plane.\n",
    "    * `is_partly_within_image(image)`: Determines whether at least parts of the bounding box are inside the image plane.\n",
    "    * `clip_out_of_image(image)`: Clips off all parts of the bounding box that are outside of the image plane.\n",
    "    * `shift([x], [y])`: Moves the bounding box.\n",
    "    * `draw_on_image(image, [color], [alpha], [size], [copy], [raise_if_out_of_image])`: Draws the bounding box and its label on an image.\n",
    "    * `draw_label_on_image(image, [color], [color_text], [color_bg], [alpha], [size], [size_text], [height], [copy], [raise_if_out_of_image])`: Draws only a rectangle containing the label (text) on an image (above the bounding box).\n",
    "    * `draw_box_on_image(image, [color], [alpha], [size], [copy], [raise_if_out_of_image)`: Draws only the box of the bounding box on an image.\n",
    "    * `extract_from_image(image, [pad], [pad_max], [prevent_zero_size])`: Extracts the pixels contained in a bounding box from an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API: BoundingBoxesOnImage\n",
    "\n",
    "`imgaug.augmentables.bbs.BoundingBoxesOnImage(bounding_boxes, shape)`: Container for a list of bounding boxes placed on an image. The `shape` argument denotes the shape of the image on which the bounding boxes are placed. It is required to make sure that augmentations based on the image size are aligned between the image and the bounding boxes placed on it (e.g. cropping).\n",
    "  * Important methods offered by `BoundingBoxesOnImage` are:\n",
    "    * `on(image)`: Projects the bounding box(es) onto another image.\n",
    "    * `from_xyxy_array(xyxy, shape)`: Creates a `BoundingBoxesOnImage` instance from an `(N,4)` numpy array.\n",

    "    * `remove_out_of_image([fully], [partly])`: Removes bounding box that are fully or at least partially outside of the image plane.\n",
    "    * `clip_out_of_image()`: Calls `clip_out_of_image()` on all bounding boxes.\n",

    "## API: Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounding boxes can be augmented using the method `augment(images=..., bounding_boxes=...)`. Alternatively, `augment_bounding_boxes()` can be used, which accepts either a single instance of `BoundingBoxesOnImage` or a list of that class.\n",
