    "\n",
    "Polygons consist of corner points that are connected by a line, which encapsulates an inner polygon area. For a polygon to be valid, the line must not intersect with itself, must not overlap and the inner area must be non-zero (which also means that a valid polygon must have at least three corner points).\n",

    "\n",
    "`imgaug.augmentables.polys.Polygon(exterior, [label])`: Container for a single polygon. The exterior is the \"border\" of the polygon and is made up of corner points, e.g. `Polygon([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10)])` creates a triangle (each point is given as `(x, y)` in absolute (sub-)pixel coordinates.\n",
    "* Properties offered by `Polygon` are: `.exterior` (all corner points), `.label` (the polygon's class label, may be `None`), `.xx` (x-coordinates of all corner points), `.yy` (analogous), `.xx_int` (`.xx` rounded to integers), `.yy_int` (analogous), ( `.height` (height of the polygon), `.width` (analogous), `.area` (area of the polygon) and `.is_valid` (returns whether the polygon is valid, i.e. has no self-intersections or overlapping segments).\n",
    "* Methods offered by `Polygon` are:\n",
    "  * `project(from_shape, to_shape)`: Project the polygon from image shape `from_shape` onto image shape `to_shape`, i.e. change the corner point coordinates. This is useful when resizing images.\n",
    "  * `find_closest_point_index(x, y, return_distance=False)`: For a given coordinate, find the index of the closest corner point (according to euclidean distance).\n",
    "  * `is_fully_within_image(image)`: Returns whether the whole polygon area is inside the image plane.\n",
    "  * `is_partly_within_image(image)`: Returns whether at least some parts of the polygon area are inside the image plane.\n",
    "  * `is_out_of_image(image, fully=True, partly=False)`: Returns whether the whole polygon area is outside of the image plane (`fully=True`) or some of that area (`partly=True`) or either of these cases (`fully=True, partly=True`).\n",
    "  * `clip_out_of_image(image)`: Clips off parts of the polygon that are outside of the image plane.\n",
    "  * `shift(x=0, y=0)`: Shift the polygon along the x/y axis.\n",
    "  * `draw_on_image(image, color=(0, 255, 0), color_face=None, color_lines=None, color_points=None, alpha=1.0, alpha_face=None, alpha_lines=None, alpha_points=None, size=1, size_lines=None, size_points=None, raise_if_out_of_image=False)`: Draw the polygon on a given image. This will draw an inner area (\"face\"), a border (\"line\") and the corner points (\"points\").\n",
    "  * `extract_from_image(image)`: Extract pixels within the polygon from an image. Returns a rectangle that matches the dimensions of a bounding box around the polygon. All pixels that were not inside the polygon are set to zero (i.e. black).\n",
    "  * `change_first_point_by_coords(x, y, max_distance=1e-4, raise_if_too_far_away=True)`: Reorders the points in `.exterior` so that the closest one to a given coordinate becomes the first point.\n",

Alternatively, `augment_polygons(polygons_on_image)` can be used, which is also offered by all augmenters. It expects either a single instance of `PolygonsOnImage` or a list of it. It does *not* accept `Polygon` instances, because these lack the necessary image shape information in the form of `.shape`.\n",

    "Some methods that operate on polygons may require them to be *valid* (i.e. \"concave\"). A polygon is valid if it has at least three corner points, does not self-intersect, has no segments that are overlapping and an area that is greater than zero. Particularly the self-intersection criterion is problematic for the case of augmentation, as some techniques may shift corner points in a way that leads to self-intersection. This is currently the case in `imgaug` for `ElasticTransformation` and `PiecewiseAffine`. For these augmenters, `imgaug` automatically verifies after augmentation whether the polygons are still valid. If they are not, it will try to repair them. While it will do its best to keep the old shape as much as possible, you should be under no illusion that this is an error-prone process that may result in polygons that are technically valid, but appear broken to a human (and don't match the object anymore). Though it will always produce at least some valid polygon (and may fall back to the convex hull to achieve that). Polygon repairing can also be a slow process, particularly when the polygon has many corner points. Because of these factors, one should reduce the likelihood of getting invalid polygons as much as possible. This can be achieved by (a) not using `ElasticTransformation` or `PiecewiseAffine` or (b) reducing the strength of these augmenters (`alpha` is `ElasticTransformation` and `scale` in `PiecewiseAffine`). Note also that the number of corner points is an influencing factor here. Having many corner points close to each other increases the risk of self-intersections. For coarse polygons and non-extreme strengths in `ElasticTransformation` or `PiecewiseAffine`, it seems to be fairly unlikely to run into invalid polygons."

    "The drawing methods have already been introduced in previous examples.

They draw the polygon(s) on image `image` and use color `color`, opacity `alpha` and size `size` for that. The other color values control the inner polygon's area (`color_face`), the polygon's border (`color_lines`) and the polygon's corner point color (`color_points`). They are automatically derived from `color` if they are not set (line and points are a bit darker than the inner polygon area). The behaviour for `alpha_*` is analogous (line and points are less transparent than the inner area). The argument `size` controls the thickness and size of the polygon's line and points. By default, the size of the line `size_lines` is the same as `size` and `size_points` is `3*size`. `raise_if_out_of_image=True` raises an exception if the polygon (or any polygon in the case of `PolygonsOnImage`) is completely outside of the image plane."

It allows deviations of up to `max_distance` between each point and the closest edge on the other polygon, measured by euclidean distance. The used algorithm is approximative and may produce wrong outputs in rare corner cases. To decrease the probability of errors, `points_per_edge` can be increased, which controls how many points are to be interpolated (and hence compared with the other polygon) on each edge."
