    "`imgaug` separates its augmentation into two mode: stochastic and deterministic mode. Both perform nearly the same steps. When calling an augmentation function they roughly do:\n",
    "* **Stochastic Mode**: \n",
    "  1. Start with random number generator $R$ (e.g. provided in initializer).\n",
    "  2. Copy $R$ to $R_c$.\n",
    "  3. Sample random values from $R_c$.\n",
    "  4. Augment images based on sampled random values.\n",
    "  5. Throw away $R_c$.\n",
    "  6. Forward $R$ (so that the next call leads to different random numbers).\n",
    "* **Deterministic Mode**:\n",
    "  1. Start with random number generator $R$ (e.g. provided in initializer).\n",
    "  2. Copy $R$ to $R_c$.\n",
    "  3. Sample random values from $R_c$.\n",
    "  4. Augment images based on sampled random values.\n",
    "  5. Throw away $R_c$.\n",
    "  6. **[different]** Keep $R$ unchanged (or reset it to state in (1) if it was somehow changed). The next call will therefore lead to the same samples in step (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, if you feed the same batch multiple times into augmenters running in deterministic mode you will get multiple times the exactly same augmentations. Usually, this is not what you want and that is why stochastic mode is the default setting. If however you have two or more batches of images that require the same augmentations, then deterministic mode is the preferred setting. This could be the case e.g. for inputs into siamese networks or for multiple frames from video sequences. The most common use case however are different types data for the same image. E.g. if you have images and bounding boxes on them, the bounding boxes have to be augmented in exactly the same way as the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: While it is possible to augment multi-input data (e.g. images + bounding boxes) by switching *manually* to deterministic mode, as described in this notebook, the *recommended* way is to feed all inputs at the same time into the augmentation call. E.g. one could use `augmenter(images=images, bounding_boxes=bbs)` to augment both images and bounding boxes on them in the same way. Aside from `images` and `bounding_boxes`, the method also accepts `heatmaps`, `segmentation_maps`, `keypoints`, `line_strings` and `polygons` as parameters."

If we trained on this without shuffling the dataset, we would always get the same augmentation for each image between epochs. That would make the augmentation process in most use cases pointless as we would have converted one static dataset into another static dataset. In order to fix this, we have to switch several times into deterministic mode, once per batch. Upon each such switch, the random number generator of the augmenter is set to a different state, which will cause augmentations *between batches* to differ."
